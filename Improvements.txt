The improvements needed in the api side are:

The API should be supporting CORS/jsonp
Also, the API should return the response back, when you POST, DELETE any object
the error messages from the api should be well formatted.
The api accepts content type as application/x-www-form-urlencoded which would be preferred as application/json
